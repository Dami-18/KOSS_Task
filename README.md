# KOSS_Task
The given below tasks use Async/Await from the asyncio package and the aiohttp package to achieve concurrency in Python. 
## Task 1
This task creates 3 coroutines and downloads files from webpage asynchronously.
## Task 2
In this task, json responses have been downloaded from 200 URLs in both ways: Asynchronously and Synchronously.
In synchronous manner, time taken for execution was about 312.91 seconds.
Using async/await and aiohttp, the json responses were downloaded asynchronously. This resulted in execution time of about 4.085 seconds.
