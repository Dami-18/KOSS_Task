# KOSS_Task
The given below task highlights how python tackles the problem of locked threading with its concurrency paradigm to provide added performance using multiple threads. It also compares the concurrency paradigms with C++ and Golang.

## Learnings from this task:
* Synchronous and Asynchronous programming
* Real-world applications of concurrent programming
* Implemeting concurrency using Multithreading and Asyncio in Python
* Differences between concurrecy paradigms in Python, Golang and C++

Some example code snippets have been inserted in the presentation which implements multithreading and asynchronous programming and compares their execution times with synchronous programs.
Other code files have been uploaded in the repo.
